1. Overview of Project:

The main purpose of this analysis is to uncover the hidden trends of Crowdfunding projects and suggest Louise with the best solution for
her crowdfunding project.

2. Analysis and challenges

As the data provided are very detailed and covers lots of stuffs including Goal amount, pledged amount, country of origin, various catagories
and subcatagories, there was always a challange to choose the best amoung the catagories and the sub catagories. On a top of that there was 
always the effect of goal amount and country of origin while choosing the project.

Since Louise was more interested in the catagory "Theater" we concentrate out analysis on it.

3. Result of Analysis

We take two basic results during analysis

a) Analysis based on the Launched date  
b) Analysis based on Goal amount of the project.

   
   Analysis based on the Launched date:
   
   
  ![](https://github.com/Spandanson/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Resources/Theater%20outcomes%20vs%20launched%20date.png)
   
     
     
     
     The Launched date analysis suggest the the projects Launched in the middle of the year i.e from May, June, July, August are more successful
      than anyother months.

   Analysis based on Goal amount of the project.

      The analysis based on goal amont suggest the the projects with the less goal amount have higher success rates the the projects with high goal 
      amount.The projects with the mid goal amount between 20000 to 35000 have more failure percentage that success percentage.However the 
      projects with the goal amount between 35000 to 45000 have more success pecentage.

4.Limitations:

 The analysis is limited to the catagory "Theater" only as Louiseis  is more intrested on that, but we can comparie various catagoies to get the 
 best outcomes. In this particul analysis as well we can to the analysis base on the pledged amount and the Created date to get more accurate results.
